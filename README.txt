"Invasion" is a program I wrote while I was self-studying python basics. 
The Program and its inner works are mainly guided by the book, Python Crash Course.

In this game, you will have three chances, meaning you'll revive for three threes to shoot down the aliens. 
Your level will go up for each round you win (shooting down all the aliens). Time is limited for each around and you must shoot down all the aliens to win.
The difficulty level will slightly increase as your level goes up.
In the game, you will see some statistics. 
The numbers in middle-top and top-left corner are your high score and points respectively.
The number below your points is your current level in the game.

To start the game, simply click 'start' button and type 'q' or 'quit' to end the program.
Use arrows to move your ship and 'spacebar' to shoot bullets.
This is my first ever experience with python so please forgive me.

Anyways, Don't let the aliens rule!! Enjoy The Arcade!
